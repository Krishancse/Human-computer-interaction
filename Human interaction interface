# Human-computer-interaction- 
computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. 
While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design.
The Meteoric Rise of HCI HCI surfaced in the 1980s with the advent of personal computing, just as machines such as the Apple Macintosh, IBM PC 5150 and Commodore 64 started turning up in homes and offices in society-changing numbers.
For the first time, sophisticated electronic systems were available to general consumers for uses such as word processors, games units and accounting aids.
Consequently, as computers were no longer room-sized, expensive tools exclusively built for experts in specialized environments, the need to create human-computer interaction that was also easy and efficient for less experienced users became increasingly vital.
From its origins, HCI would expand to incorporate multiple disciplines, such as computer science, cognitive science and human-factors engineering.
HCI soon became the subject of intense academic investigation.
Those who studied and worked in HCI saw it as a crucial instrument to popularize the idea that the interaction between a computer and the user should resemble a human-to-human, open-ended dialogue. 
Initially, HCI researchers focused on improving the usability of desktop computers (i.e., practitioners concentrated on how easy computers are to learn and use). 
However, with the rise of technologies such as the Internet and the smartphone, computer use would increasingly move away from the desktop to embrace the mobile world. 
Also, HCI has steadily encompassed more fields:…it no longer makes sense to regard HCI as a specialty of computer science; HCI has grown to be broader, larger and much more diverse than computer science itself.
HCI expanded from its initial focus on individual and generic user behavior to include social and organizational computing, accessibility for the elderly, the cognitively and physically impaired, and for all people, and for the widest possible spectrum of human experiences and activities.
It expanded from desktop office applications to include games, learning and education, commerce, health and medical applications, emergency planning and response, and systems to support collaboration and community.
It expanded from early graphical user interfaces to include myriad interaction techniques and devices, multi-modal interactions, tool support for model-based user interface specification, and a host of emerging ubiquitous, handheld and context-aware interactions.”
The challenge of personal computing became manifest at an opportune time. The broad project of cognitive science, which incorporated cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, cognitive anthropology, and the philosophy of mind, had formed at the end of the 1970s. 
Part of the programme of cognitive science was to articulate systematic and scientifically informed applications to be known as "cognitive engineering". Thus, at just the point when personal computing presented the practical need for HCI, cognitive science presented people, concepts, skills, and a vision for addressing such needs through an ambitious synthesis of science and engineering.
HCI was one of the first examples of cognitive engineering.This was facilitated by analogous developments in engineering and design areas adjacent to HCI, and in fact often overlapping HCI, notably human factors engineering and documentation development.
Human factors had developed empirical and task-analytic techniques for evaluating human-system interactions in domains such as aviation and manufacturing, and was moving to address interactive system contexts in which human operators regularly exerted greater problem-solving discretion. 
Documentation development was moving beyond its traditional role of producing systematic technical descriptions toward a cognitive approach incorporating theories of writing, reading, and media, with empirical user testing. 
Documents and other information needed to be usable also. Data Visualization and Human Perception Data visualization is effective because it shifts the balance between perception and cognition to take fuller advantage of the brain's abilities. 
Seeing (i.e visual perception) which is handled by the visual cortex located in the rear of the brain, is extremely fast and efficient. We see immediately, with little effort. 
Thinking (i.e. cognition), which is handled primarily by the cerebral cortex in the front of the brain, is much slower and less efficient.
Traditional data sensemaking and presentation methods require conscious thinking for almost all of the work. 
Data visualization shifts the balance toward greater use of visual perception, taking advantage of our powerful eyes whenever possible. 
Importance of HCI The study of human-computer interaction aims to create a conversation between people and machines that seems natural and intuitive.
A superior user experience that doesn't necessitate a lot of physical or mental effort is what designers and product developers strive to achieve. 
Humans use digital devices to do various jobs, and effective human-computer interfaces are essential.
Lack of consideration for human-computer interaction can result in poorly designed user interfaces that have an adverse effect on product usability and raise the likelihood of product failure. 
Designers can gain invaluable knowledge about ergonomics, usability, user behaviors, emotional responses, user goals, and user personas by researching human-computer interaction. 
The ultimate goal of HCI is to reduce the amount of effort a user expends when using technology. It aspires to make interactions between people and computers as simple, natural, and open-ended as interactions between people.
Components of Human-Computer Interaction HCI is primarily composed of four essential elements: The User An individual or a group of individuals who work together on a project is referred to as the user component.
HCI researches the needs, objectives, and interaction styles of users. 
The Goal-Oriented Task When using a computer, a user always has a purpose or aim in mind. To achieve this, the computer presents a digital representation of things.
The Interface An essential HCI element that can improve the quality of user interaction is the interface.
Many interface-related factors need to be taken into account, including the type of interaction, screen resolution, display size, and even color contrast.
The Context HCI is not only about providing better communication between users and computers but also about factoring in the context and environment in which the system is accessed.

However, how do engineers and designers come up with usable, simple computer interfaces? Here we have Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). What Is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)?
HCI is the study of how people interact with computers, especially as it relates to technology design. User-centered design, UI, and UX are combined with HCI to provide intuitive technology and products. 
HCI specialists consider how to develop and deploy computer systems that satisfy human users.
The majority of this research focuses on enhancing human-computer interaction by enhancing how people utilize and comprehend an interface. 
The Rise of HCI As a means of examining how and why computers might be made more user-friendly, HCI emerged in the early 1980s. 
In a short period of time, the research area expanded to practically encompass all IT. It changed everything when Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984. 
The usage of computers has become much more accessible, making communication simpler. Keyboard, mouse, and icon-based user interfaces were popular during this period
. Despite the fact that it has expanded significantly since its inception, the field of human-computer interaction will keep growing as more information about users and computers is learned.
Giving users additional options and adopting a more humane stance to accommodate people with various preferences, disabilities, and fears, new HCI methodologies are striving to personalize interaction tools and processes as much as feasible. 
In addition to the exponential growth of HCI possibilities, sign systems are adopting technologies created for phones, homes, and other personal devices more swiftly.
