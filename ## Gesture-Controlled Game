Welcome to the Gesture-Controlled Game repository! Our project aims to redefine the way you interact with video games by putting you in control through physical gestures and movements. Imagine navigating a virtual world, unleashing powerful attacks, and making critical decisions—all with the simple wave of a hand or the swing of an arm. Say goodbye to traditional controllers and keyboards, and say hello to a new era of immersive gaming.

### What is Gesture-Controlled Gaming?

Gesture-Controlled Gaming is a revolutionary approach to gaming that allows players to use their natural movements to control and influence the game. With the help of cutting-edge technologies such as sensors, cameras, and gesture recognition algorithms, we've created a gaming experience that responds to your every move, making you an integral part of the gameplay.

### Key Features
