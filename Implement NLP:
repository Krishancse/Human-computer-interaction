Step 1: Include Required Libraries:

You'll need the Stanford NLP library. Include it in your Java project's dependencies.

Step 2: Implement NLP:
import edu.stanford.nlp.simple.*;

public class NLPExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample text for NLP processing
        String text = "I want to book a flight to New York next week.";

        // Initialize the Stanford NLP pipeline
        Document doc = new Document(text);

        // Perform NLP analysis
        for (Sentence sentence : doc.sentences()) {
            // Get the lemmas (base forms) of the words
            System.out.println("Lemmas: " + sentence.lemmas());

            // Get the named entities
            System.out.println("Named Entities: " + sentence.nerTags());

            // Get the part-of-speech tags
            System.out.println("POS Tags: " + sentence.posTags());

            // Get the syntactic dependencies
            System.out.println("Dependencies: " + sentence.dependencyParse());
        }
    }
}
, the Stanford NLP library is used to analyze a sample text. The code retrieves lemmas, named entities, part-of-speech tags, and syntactic dependencies for each sentence in the text.

Please note that this example uses the Stanford NLP library, and you'll need to include the necessary JAR files in your project.

Keep in mind that integrating NLP with HIC might require additional steps or modifications based on how HIC handles NLP functionalities. Always refer to the HIC documentation for guidance on integrating external libraries and APIs.

If your HIC framework offers built-in NLP capabilities, you should follow their documentation and APIs to perform NLP tasks within the framework.
