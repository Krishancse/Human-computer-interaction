Contextual understanding involves processing user input and maintaining context to provide meaningful responses. This can be achieved using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. While creating a full contextual understanding system involves multiple components, I'll provide you with a simplified Java example using the Stanford CoreNLP library to demonstrate basic contextual understanding:

**Step 1: Set Up Stanford CoreNLP:**

Download the Stanford CoreNLP library from its official website and include the necessary JAR files in your Java project.

**Step 2: Implement Contextual Understanding:**

```java
import edu.stanford.nlp.simple.Document;
import edu.stanford.nlp.simple.Sentence;

public class ContextualUnderstanding {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "What's the weather like in New York tomorrow?";

        // Initialize the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline
        Document doc = new Document(text);

        // Process each sentence in the text
        for (Sentence sentence : doc.sentences()) {
            // Extract named entities
            System.out.println("Named Entities: " + sentence.nerTags());

            // Extract verb phrases (contextual understanding)
            System.out.println("Verb Phrases: " + sentence.verbs());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We use the Stanford CoreNLP library to process a sample text containing a question about the weather.
2. The `Document` class is used to process the text, and each `Sentence` is processed individually.
3. We extract named entities using the `nerTags()` method, which helps in understanding key entities in the sentence.
4. We extract verb phrases using the `verbs()` method, which helps in understanding the action or intent of the sentence.

Please note that this example is a simplified demonstration and doesn't cover the full spectrum of contextual understanding. A more comprehensive system might involve deeper NLP analysis, entity resolution, syntactic parsing, and more.

For complex contextual understanding systems, consider using more advanced NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK, and if needed, incorporate machine learning techniques and domain-specific knowledge to enhance the accuracy of understanding user context.
