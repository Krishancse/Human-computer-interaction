### Examples

- Include screenshots, GIFs, or videos demonstrating different interactions with the HIC.
To showcase how the Human Interaction Computer (HIC) recognizes gestures, voice inputs, and facial expressions, you can provide visual examples in your project's documentation. Use screenshots, images, diagrams, and annotations to explain the process of recognition. Here's how you might showcase each recognition method:

### Gesture Recognition

#### Gesture Detection

![Gesture Detection](gesture-detection.png)
*Illustration of a user performing a hand swipe gesture.*

Explain how the system uses cameras or sensors to capture user gestures. Include images or illustrations demonstrating the different gestures the system can detect, such as hand swipes, thumbs up, or finger pointing. You could also show the user's silhouette with detected points to illustrate the tracking process.

#### Gesture Mapping

![Gesture Mapping](gesture-mapping.png)
*Mapping hand swipes to in-game actions.*

Show how recognized gestures are mapped to specific in-game actions. Provide a visual representation of how, for example, a hand swipe to the right corresponds to moving a character to the right in the game. Include a table or diagram that lists each gesture and its corresponding action.

### Voice Command Recognition

#### Voice Input

![Voice Input](voice-input.png)
*User giving a voice command.*

Illustrate a user speaking into a microphone, showing the system's ability to capture voice inputs. You can also include a waveform visualization of the audio input to make it more engaging.

#### Speech-to-Text Conversion

![Speech-to-Text Conversion](speech-to-text.png)
*Converting voice command to text.*

Explain how the recorded voice input is converted into text using speech recognition algorithms. Show a visual representation of the spoken words being transcribed into text.

#### Command Execution

![Command Execution](command-execution.png)
*Executing an action based on recognized voice command.*

Demonstrate how the recognized voice command triggers a specific action within the application. This could be navigating through menus, performing tasks, or controlling game elements.

### Facial Expression Recognition

#### Facial Expression Capture

![Facial Expression Capture](facial-expression-capture.png)
*Capturing a user's facial expression.*

Show a user with a camera capturing their facial expressions. You can include facial landmarks or key points to illustrate how the system detects different expressions.

#### Expression Mapping

![Expression Mapping](expression-mapping.png)
*Mapping facial expressions to reactions in the application.*

Illustrate how different facial expressions are mapped to reactions in the application. For example, a smile might trigger a positive response, while a frown might trigger a concerned response.

By combining visual aids with clear explanations, you can effectively showcase how your HIC recognizes gestures, voice inputs, and facial expressions. These visualizations will help users understand the technology and its capabilities more intuitively.
