Implementing AI for a Gesture-Controlled Game involves using machine learning models to recognize gestures and translate them into game actions. Below is a simple example using TensorFlow and a mock gesture classification model to control a basic game character's movement:

```python
import time
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the AI model for gesture recognition
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('gesture_model.h5')  # Replace with actual model path

# Define actions corresponding to gestures
actions = ['Move Left', 'Move Right', 'Jump', 'No Action']

# Simulate gesture recognition with mock sensor data
def recognize_gesture(sensor_data):
    gesture_probs = model.predict(sensor_data)
    recognized_action = actions[gesture_probs.argmax()]
    return recognized_action

# Simulate sensor data (replace with actual sensor data)
sensor_data = [[0.1, 0.5, 0.2]]  # Replace with actual sensor data

# Main loop
while True:
    recognized_action = recognize_gesture(sensor_data)
    print(f"Recognized Gesture: {recognized_action}")
    
    # Perform corresponding action in the game (e.g., control character movement)
    # ... (add your action logic here)
    
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate gesture recognition frequency
```

In this example:
- We load an AI model using TensorFlow for gesture recognition (replace `'gesture_model.h5'` with the actual model path).
- We define a list of actions corresponding to gestures.
- We simulate gesture recognition using mock sensor data. Replace the `sensor_data` with actual sensor data.
- The `recognize_gesture` function predicts the recognized gesture based on the AI model's output probabilities.
- The recognized gesture is used to perform in-game actions (e.g., controlling character movement).

For a real Gesture-Controlled Game, you'd replace the mock sensor data with actual sensor input and implement gesture recognition logic that aligns with your game's gestures. Additionally, the AI model should be trained on a dataset of actual gestures.

Remember that real-world gesture recognition often involves complex preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Depending on the complexity of your game and the accuracy you require, you might need more sophisticated AI models or deep learning architectures tailored to your gesture recognition needs.
