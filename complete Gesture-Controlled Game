Creating a complete Gesture-Controlled Game involves a significant amount of code and integration across various components, including hardware, sensors, GPU, and AI. While I can't provide an entire game's worth of code here, I can offer a simplified example of how you might start integrating these components using Python and some common libraries. Please note that this is a basic example for demonstration purposes.

Let's assume you're using a webcam for gesture recognition and a basic AI model for gesture classification. We'll create a simple game where the user can control the movement of a character using hand gestures.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the AI model for gesture classification
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('gesture_model.h5')

# Open a webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Main loop
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Preprocess the frame (resize, normalize, etc.)
    processed_frame = preprocess(frame)

    # Use the AI model to predict the gesture
    gesture_prediction = model.predict(processed_frame)

    # Determine the action based on the predicted gesture
    action = get_action_from_gesture(gesture_prediction)

    # Update the game state based on the action

    # Display the frame with overlays
    display_frame = overlay(frame, action)

    cv2.imshow('Gesture-Controlled Game', display_frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In this example, you'd need to replace the placeholder functions with actual implementations for preprocessing the frame, determining the action from the predicted gesture, updating the game state, and overlaying graphics on the frame.

The key libraries used here are:
- `cv2` (OpenCV) for capturing video from the webcam and image processing.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `tensorflow` for loading and using the AI model.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and a full Gesture-Controlled Game would require much more complexity, including game mechanics, graphics, gesture recognition optimization, and a more sophisticated AI model. Additionally, integrating hardware components, sensors, and handling GPU acceleration would involve deeper integration and more code.

For accurate gesture recognition and game development, consider collaborating with experts in computer vision, AI, and game development or leveraging existing libraries and frameworks tailored to your needs.
