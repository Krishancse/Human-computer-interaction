The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) requirements for creating a Gesture-Controlled Game can vary based on factors such as the complexity of the game, the level of graphics quality, and the specific gesture recognition technologies you plan to use. While the GPU is primarily responsible for rendering graphics, it can also contribute to other tasks such as real-time image processing and machine learning inference, which may be relevant to gesture recognition.

Here are some considerations when determining the GPU requirements for your Gesture-Controlled Game:

1. **Graphics Quality:** If your game aims to deliver high-quality graphics with detailed textures, lighting effects, and visual fidelity, you'll need a more powerful GPU to handle the rendering demands.

2. **Real-Time Image Processing:** If your gesture recognition involves real-time image processing, such as analyzing camera input to detect gestures, the GPU's parallel processing capabilities can significantly speed up these tasks.

3. **Machine Learning Inference:** If you're using machine learning models for gesture recognition, a GPU with CUDA support can accelerate model inference and improve the real-time performance of gesture recognition algorithms.

4. **Virtual Reality (VR):** If you're creating a Gesture-Controlled VR Game, VR environments are demanding on GPUs due to the need for rendering two viewpoints simultaneously and maintaining high frame rates.

5. **Camera Input:** Cameras used for gesture recognition might require additional processing power for video capture and analysis, especially if you're dealing with high-resolution camera feeds.

6. **Unity or Unreal Engine:** If you're using game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, the GPU's capabilities will influence the graphics performance and the potential for integrating gesture recognition libraries.

7. **Multitasking:** Consider whether you'll be running multiple applications simultaneously, as this can impact the available GPU resources.

8. **Future-Proofing:** Depending on the project's scale and the rapid advancements in technology, investing in a more capable GPU can ensure your game remains relevant for a longer period.

As of my last update in September 2021, here are some general GPU recommendations based on usage scenarios:

- **Entry-Level:** For basic 2D games or simple gesture recognition, an entry-level GPU like NVIDIA GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon RX 550 could suffice.

- **Mid-Range:** For moderate 3D graphics and more advanced gesture recognition, consider GPUs like NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT.

- **High-End:** If you're targeting high-quality graphics, VR, or complex gesture recognition, higher-end GPUs like NVIDIA RTX 3070 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT offer strong performance.

- **Professional GPUs:** If your project involves significant machine learning tasks for gesture recognition, consider NVIDIA's RTX series or AMD's Radeon Pro GPUs.

Keep in mind that technology is continuously evolving, so it's a good idea to research the latest GPU models, their specifications, and any advancements in GPU architecture and technologies that can enhance your Gesture-Controlled Game development.
