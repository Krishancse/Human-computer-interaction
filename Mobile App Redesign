Sure, here's a simplified example of how you might approach a mobile app redesign using HCI principles and Java programming. 
In this example, I'll focus on the basic structure and layout changes without getting into detailed UI components.

Let's assume you're redesigning a weather forecasting app:

**Step 1: User Research and Analysis**

Gather user feedback to understand pain points and needs:
```java
// Code to gather user feedback through surveys or interviews
```

**Step 2: Task Analysis**

Identify common tasks and actions within the app:
```java
// Code to analyze user tasks and interactions
```

**Step 3: Wireframing and Prototyping**

Create a basic prototype using Java and Swing (for simplicity):
```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class WeatherAppRedesign {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Weather App Redesign");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(400, 600);
        
        JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();
        // Create and add UI components here (labels, buttons, etc.)
        
        frame.add(mainPanel);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

**Step 4: Accessibility Implementation**

Implement accessibility features using Java Swing's accessibility classes:
```java
import javax.accessibility.Accessible;
import javax.swing.*;

public class AccessibleWeatherApp extends JFrame implements Accessible {
    // Code to implement accessibility features
}
```

**Step 5: Visual Design and UI Enhancements**

Enhance the UI using Java Swing components:
```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class WeatherAppRedesign {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Weather App Redesign");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(400, 600);
        
        JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();
        // Create and add enhanced UI components
        
        frame.add(mainPanel);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

**Step 6: Usability Testing**

Conduct usability testing with real users to gather feedback:
```java
// Code to conduct usability testing and gather feedback
```

**Step 7: Iterative Design and Refinement**

Refine the UI based on user feedback and testing results:
```java
// Code to refine the UI components and layout
```

Please note that this is a simplified example and does not cover every aspect of a full redesign project.
Additionally, Java's Swing library might not be the most modern choice for mobile app development, as Android or iOS development frameworks would be more suitable for real-world projects.
For a complete project, you would need to implement actual UI components, handle user interactions, and potentially use a modern UI framework like JavaFX for creating mobile-like interfaces. 
Additionally, you would also need to handle API calls for weather data, implement navigation, and consider many other aspects of mobile app development.
