Certainly! Error handling is a crucial aspect of creating a robust Voice User Interface (VUI). Here's an example of how you can implement error handling in a Java-based VUI code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class VoiceUserInterface {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Hello! How can I assist you today?");
        while (true) {
            String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
            String response = processUserInput(userInput);
            System.out.println(response);
        }
    }

    public static String processUserInput(String userInput) {
        if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("hello")) {
            return "Hi there! How can I help you?";
        } else if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("weather")) {
            try {
                // Simulate an error by dividing by zero
                int result = 10 / 0;
            } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                return "I'm sorry, there was an error while fetching the weather.";
            }
        } else if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("bye")) {
            return "Goodbye! Have a great day!";
        }

        return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand your request.";
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. The program displays a welcome message and enters a loop to continuously interact with the user.
2. The `processUserInput` method handles user input and contains logic to provide appropriate responses.
3. When the user inputs "hello," the program responds with a greeting.
4. When the user inputs "weather," the program simulates an error by attempting to divide by zero, catching the `ArithmeticException`, and responding with an error message.
5. When the user inputs "bye," the program responds with a farewell message and exits.

Please adapt this example to your specific VUI framework and requirements. Incorporate proper exception handling, user-friendly error messages, and appropriate recovery mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience even in error scenarios.
