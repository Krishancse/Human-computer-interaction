Certainly! You can use the Java `javax.sound.sampled` library to implement basic text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. Here's a simple example of how you can use Java to convert text to speech:

```java
import javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat;
import javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem;
import javax.sound.sampled.LineUnavailableException;
import javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine;

public class TextToSpeech {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello, this is a text-to-speech example.";

        try {
            textToSpeech(text);
        } catch (LineUnavailableException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void textToSpeech(String text) throws LineUnavailableException {
        // Set up audio format
        AudioFormat format = new AudioFormat(44100, 16, 1, true, false);
        
        // Open the audio line
        try (SourceDataLine line = AudioSystem.getSourceDataLine(format)) {
            line.open(format);
            line.start();

            // Convert text to bytes and play
            byte[] bytes = text.getBytes();
            line.write(bytes, 0, bytes.length);

            // Wait for the sound to finish playing
            line.drain();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. The `textToSpeech` method takes a string of text as input and uses the `javax.sound.sampled` library to convert the text into speech.
2. The `AudioFormat` defines the audio characteristics such as sample rate, sample size, channels, and signed/unsigned data.
3. The `SourceDataLine` is used to open the audio line and play the converted text as sound.
4. The text is converted to bytes using `getBytes()`, and then the bytes are written to the audio line using `write()`.

Please note that this is a basic example and doesn't provide natural-sounding speech synthesis. For more advanced and natural-sounding TTS, you might want to explore third-party TTS APIs and libraries like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or other solutions that provide high-quality speech synthesis.

Additionally, modern TTS systems usually provide more advanced features like choosing voice styles, adjusting speech rate, and supporting different languages and accents. If you need more sophisticated TTS capabilities, consider using specialized TTS libraries or APIs.
